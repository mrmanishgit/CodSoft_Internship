General Tips for Commenting in Java:
Brief and Clear: Use comments to clarify the purpose of code blocks, not to restate the obvious. For example, don't comment every line if the code is self-explanatory.
Javadoc: Use Javadoc comments (/** ... */) to document classes and methods, especially for public APIs or complex functions.
Consistency: Make sure the comments follow a consistent style. For example, if you use // for short comments, stick to that throughout the project.
Here's an example of a Javadoc comment for a method:
-------------------------------------------
java
Copy code
/**
 * This method checks the balance of the ATM account.
 * @return The current balance of the account.
 */
public double checkBalance() {
    return balance;
}
